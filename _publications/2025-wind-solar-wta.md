  Local opposition to renewable energy project development is intensifying across the U.S., driven by concerns about property rights, land use, agriculture production, aesthetics, and visual impacts. This study uses data from a discrete choice experiment in the northeastern U.S.—a region experiencing particularly acute opposition—to examine residents’ preferences for siting wind and solar energy projects. We explore the impact of landscape changes, agricultural production, industry cooperation, and financial compensation to various stakeholder groups. We make three key contributions. First, we provide the first stated preference assessment comparing the relative importance of aesthetic and agricultural concerns, finding that visual impacts are the main source of opposition. Second, we systematically test differentiated payment mechanisms that vary compensation across landowners, local communities, and individual residents in onshore renewable energy projects. We find that residents are willing to accept lower individual payments when communities and landowners are adequately compensated, revealing a strong preference for shared community benefits that inform the design of effective compensation schemes. Third, through latent class analysis, we identify distinct preference segments and estimate group-specific marginal willingness-to-accept (MWTA) thresholds. A tradition-oriented minority emerges as the critical constraint. While comprising less than one-fifth of respondents, this group demands markedly higher payments and is illustrative of the core of organized opposition that can block project advancement. Quantifying the compensation premium and engagement strategies needed to secure support from this conservative subgroup offers actionable guidance for developers and policymakers navigating the partisan dynamics that increasingly obstruct renewable energy deployment.
